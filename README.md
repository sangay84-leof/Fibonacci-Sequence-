# Fibonacci Sequence Calculator (Iterative) in Java

This Java program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence commonly starts as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so forth.

## Features

- **Iterative Calculation**: Utilizes a loop to compute Fibonacci numbers, making it efficient in terms of time complexity compared to recursive approaches.
  
- **Execution Time Measurement**: The program measures and displays the execution time for the Fibonacci calculation, providing insights into performance.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer, `n`, for which the Fibonacci number will be calculated.
  
2. **Fibonacci Calculation**: It uses an iterative method to compute the Fibonacci number for the given input `n`. The method handles base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` directly and computes the Fibonacci number for larger values using a loop.

3. **Output**: The calculated Fibonacci number and the execution time in nanoseconds are displayed.

## How to Run

To run the Fibonacci calculator, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your system. You can verify your installation by running `java -version` and `javac -version` in your command line.

2. Clone this repository or download the `iterative.java` file.

3. Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the directory where the `iterative.java` file is located.

4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac iterative.java
